# Spring Batch Hello World

## Goal

Getting familiar with Spring batch, especially with the annotation based configuration. The goal is not to do a lot, but to do it right.

## Hello World Project

This is a hello world project which uses XML based configuration <http://www.mkyong.com/spring-batch/spring-batch-hello-world-example/>, but here we are not using any XML configuration.
