# Spring Batch Hello World

## Goal

Getting familiar with Spring batch, especially with the annotation based configuration. The goal is not to do a lot, but to do it right.

## Hello World Project

The [following project](http://www.mkyong.com/spring-batch/spring-batch-hello-world-example/)
is used as an inspiration, but instead of XML configuration, annotations in Java are used.

Spring-Boot cuts down on maven configuration considerably, by providing opinionated defaults,
which can all be overriden. In contrast to Spring-Roo, which generates code and relies heavily
on aspects, Spring-Boot generates
no code, and it can be easily removed, once the project gets more mature, and and we made
all out own changes for
every dependency, but we are not burdned by that before we can even get started.

There is no Spring-Boot archetype, but if you are lazy like me, go to
<http://start.spring.io/> and use Spring Initializr to generated your
skeleton which compiles.
